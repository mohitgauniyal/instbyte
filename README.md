# Instbyte

**Instbyte** is a high-speed, real-time ephemeral sharing utility designed for teams and developers who need to move snippets, links, and files across devices and colleagues without the friction of traditional communication tools.

Built for efficiency, it serves as a "digital dead-drop" that lives on your local network, ensuring that your data is shared instantly and purged automatically.

## Core Features

- **Real-Time Sync**: Every action (clipboard paste, file drop, or text snippet) is instantly broadcasted to all connected team members.
- **Zero-Friction Sharing**: 
    - **Paste Anywhere**: Copy text/links and paste them directly onto the page to share.
    - **Drag & Drop**: Toss files anywhere on the interface to upload and share.
- **Contextual Channels**: Organize transfers by project or team (e.g., General, Dev, Design).
- **Searchable History**: Locate previous transfers via a lightning-fast full-text search.
- **Self-Cleaning**: A background automation ensures that everything shared is deleted after 24 hours, keeping your infrastructure clean and your data ephemeral.
- **LAN Optimization**: Designed to operate seamlessly within a local network, perfect for office environments or home labs.

## Getting Started

1. **Launch**: Start the server to begin the session.
2. **Access**: Navigate to the local URL (standard) or the provided Network IP (to share with colleagues).
3. **Share**: Type, paste, or drop. Done.

## 🛠 Why Use This?

- **Sprint Collaboration**: Quickly swap API payloads or UI screenshots during a pairing session.
- **Cross-Platform Bridge**: Move a URL from your Android/iOS phone to your Linux/Windows workstation without "emailing yourself."
- **Temporary Assets**: Store small assets or logs that you only need for a few hours.
